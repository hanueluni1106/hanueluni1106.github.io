 It was the second day of my trip. In the morning, We visited Adobe company. 
 
 <Adobe>

 
 It was so sunny. But not so wet. We took bus and went to Adobe Building... may be we arrived at the East Building. We got pictures in front of the Logo. As follow..
 
 <Adobe self shot>
  
 Ah...I got a name tag but I took a few seconds to recognize that it's my name tag. Bacause part of name had been deleted!
 In Adobe, I could see lots of wellness facilities. I thought Adobe(But maybe many companies in Silicon Valley have good wellness system.) take care of employees' health(also mental health. And after the visiting, Adobe is one of the best companies which employees want to join) 
 
 Let's talks about Adobe!
Adobe has three buildings and now they build a new building nearby. 

<Abode's new building>

And I heard that they have earned by PhotoShop...but now they earn by advising such as ...they advise customers to how to advertise their products.   
 
After visiting Adobe, we went to Google. Site of Google headquarters is so wide that we confused to arrive at the appointment. But don't worry, we arrived on time there! We ate lunch with two Google employees.

One works in Google search backend dpt. And the other works in Google Assistant. I could hear their experiences. Before listening, I just had known that google search's results were considered by the frequency of related words and they just use Page Ranks. But they aren't. They also consider photos, links! And their data was so big that they can't easily take care of..(==updates) Um.. They compare the updates of fixing up libraries. The amount of knowledges(data) are getting bigger but they need to fix up and new methods that how to rearrange the datas efficiently. Also in library, new books are piled up.. and librarians constantly arrange them. If new category is needed, they need new solution...So these processes are in progress in Google search! 

After lunch, I and my friends took pictures @ Google.

Then we went to Google souvenir center. I suggest you to buy a green and white coat( It was so cool)

And we visited computer history museum. Thanks to Hyunggon Yoo, We just paid at a discount.

I know him! I heard the name in the Lecture.

I didn't know but now I think I was very busy that day....XD

After the visiting, we went to Apple Visitor center. But, nothing special...I just wanna visit Apple headquarters. :(

In the evening, we went to thai restaurant and ate dinner. Ah..I hate smell of coriander, I hardly ate the meal...
I just ate  salmon steak...
